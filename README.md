# BASIC
>BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)[1] is a family of general-purpose, high-level >programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. The original version was designed by >John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College in 1964. They wanted to enable students >in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers >required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn.
